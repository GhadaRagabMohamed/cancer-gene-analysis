🚀 Project Workflow

🔹 1. Dataset Selection & Preprocessing

Imported gene expression datasets.

Performed data cleaning (handling missing values, normalization, etc.).

Selected suitable Python libraries for the analysis.

Chose classification algorithms: KNN, SVM, and Neural Networks.

Selected feature selection techniques:

Filter methods: ANOVA, Chi-square

Wrapper methods: RFE, Sequential Feature Selection


Chose dimensionality reduction methods: PCA, t-SNE

Designed the full project pipeline.

🔹 2. Clustering of Genes (Columns)

Applied PCA to reduce sample (row) dimensionality.

Clustered genes using:

K-Means

Hierarchical Clustering

DBSCAN


Visualized clusters using heatmaps, dendrograms, and PCA plots.
